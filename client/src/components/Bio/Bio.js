              Hey, I'm Josh. I'd like to start by saying thank you for visiting
              my website! This site was made using react, and I learned a lot
              just from coding this simple portfolio. When people ask me why I
              choose to Program; I think back to when I graduated high school. I
              was lost in life some could say. I had drive, but no direction
              struggling to choose a career path; my first thought was
              Entrepreneurship. So the first thing I did was sell my car and buy
              a truck, for the whole summer after high school I would go along
              in my truck doing odd jobs like moving furniture, appliances and
              filling in potholes. When august came and it was time for school,
              I still had no idea what I was going to do. That's when I heard
              about UNC Bootcamps, and all of a sudden I got a blast of energy,
              I remembered my cousin is a Software engineer at Upwork. I asked
              about the Bootcamp and he told me it was a pretty good idea next
              thing I know I'm enrolling myself into said Bootcamp. It was in
              the Bootcamp where I found my love for problem-solving and with
              that came my love for not only programming but also learning.

              FULLSTACK Web-Developer, Certified by UNC-Chapel Hill in
              Full-stack web development where I sharpened my skills in; HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and NoSQL databases, and Git. I applied
              aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project where I
              worked in a team of four to develop an app that allows the user to
              find the cheapest flights while also using a covid data API to
              relay local covid data for their destination. I aspire to work on,
              whether itâ€™s solely or for a company to create applications that
              make people's lives easier. As an example, I am currently
              programming an app that can map out user set routes, because as a
              street sweeper that is something my company lacks.
